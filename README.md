# -Multimodal-Analysis-of-Images-and-Text-Integration-of-Image-Processing-and-NLP-

Problem Statement:
Developing a text analysis tool to extract and evaluate articles, focusing on key variables like sentiment, complexity, and structure.

Contribution:

Data Extraction: Implemented Python code using Beautiful Soup and Selenium to extract article text from given URLs.
Textual Analysis: Utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to compute variables like sentiment, complexity, and average word length.
Tools Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Beautiful Soup, Selenium, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow (for NLP)
Outcome:

Extracted and analyzed textual data from articles, providing insights into sentiment, complexity, and structure.
Output structured data in CSV format as per project requirements.
Codebase available for potential future use and extension.
